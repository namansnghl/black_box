# BLACK BOX - Password Manager

###### BACKGROUND STORY
A year or so back I had an issue of trying to remember my passwords and I had so many login credentials to remember. I never did trust third party
software to do so for me. So, I decided to build my own password manager tool called “Black Box” using
python to save encrypted passwords locally with me.

This is only the UI. The backend is under development.
###### FUTURE PLANS
Host the application on a home NAS network and create a personal mobile application to fetch passwords when away.
